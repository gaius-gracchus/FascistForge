10:23:32 â€” @huddy: "A true idea cannot be "new", for truth is not a product of the human mind; it exists independently of us, and all we have to do is take cognizance of it; outside this knowledge there can be nothing but error: but do the moderns on the whole care much about truth, or do they even know what it is?" - The Crisis of the Modern World, p. 57
10:23:40 â€” @huddy: Nice quote I found while reading
14:04:06 â€” @huddy: "Those who will succeed in overcoming all these obstacles, and triumphing over the hostility of an environment opposed to all spirituality, will doubtless be few in number; but let it be said once more that it is not numbers that count, for we are here in a domain whose laws are quite different from those of matter. There is therefore no cause for despair, and, even were there no hope of achieving any visible result before the modern world collapses under some catastrophe, this would still be no valid reason for not undertaking a work whose scope extends far beyond the present time. Those who might be tempted to give way to despair should realize that nothing accomplished in this order can ever be lost, that confusion, error, and darkness can win the day only in appearance and in a purely ephemeral way, that all partial and transitory disequilibriums must perforce contribute toward the greater equilibrium of the whole, and that nothing can ultimately prevail against the power of truth; their motto should be the one formerly used by certain initiatic organizations of the West: Vincit omnia Veritas." - The Crisis of the Modern World, pp. 116-117

here are some possible plans

1. Pose as a rabbi in LA and say that you know who @MathiasÂ is, then make up a bogus story about how heâ€™s actually a Nigerian or some shit, giving this guy hope that he can show his faggot daddies that he did something, then @Mathiascan post a pic of him in a skull mask with a piece of paper with his username and the date, we send it to theÂ reporter fag, the perfect catfishingÂ 

2. Tell the faggotÂ that you will hand over personal information of multiple members that you know, such as names, phone numbers, pictures, etc. give the guy names of Â rabbis of secluded, unknown towns and pictures of teenage Jews (photoshopped of course) and convince him to post them on his next story

3. An interview, contact the guy and tell him that 1 or moreÂ of us will conduct an interview and fuck with him during the duration of the interviewÂ 
15:48:55 â€” @huddy: Number 3

15:50:37 â€” aeternus: So basically active at all
15:51:34 â€” mathias: I don't know much about IronVolk, I checked it out a while ago when someone sent me a link saying it was going to replace IM.
15:51:46 â€” mathias: I think their problem is the antequated forum look
15:51:55 â€” aeternus: It was created right after IM went down iirc
15:52:19 â€” aeternus: Yeah it looks too flashy and 90s style imo
15:53:22 â€” mathias: It's affilated with radio werewolf right? From what I know they're solid guys
15:53:50 â€” aeternus: Correct
15:53:57 â€” aeternus: Radio Werhwolf is my favorite podcast rn
15:54:22 â€” mathias: I listened to a few of their older broadcasts
15:54:26 â€” mathias: always enjoyed them
15:54:35 â€” mathias: but I never really followed them
15:54:39 â€” mathias: I guess I'm just a nigger
15:55:14 â€” aeternus: They did an interview with Vincent Snyder about Christian Identity recently (i think that was them at least)
15:55:22 â€” aeternus: It was pretty interesting
15:55:53 â€” mathias: Catching up on their Mansonite Menace series
15:55:57 â€” mathias: I'll have to check that out
15:57:45 â€” aeternus: Saw Chilliers was on FF
15:58:05 â€” aeternus: It seems like everywhere he goes, a heated discussion about christianity comes with him
15:59:55 â€” mathias: I don't even know anything about the kid, he just came across as one of the e-celeb types
16:00:19 â€” aeternus: Yeah he's the religiously confused 14 year old who somehow started running FashCast
16:00:45 â€” mathias: Him and a bunch of Christians showed up out of nowhere. Basically had to purge the site.
16:00:59 â€” mathias: I don't even know what the fuck FashCast is or was
16:01:10 â€” mathias: Just a bunch of drama around them
16:01:27 â€” aeternus: FashCast started because Vex wanted to be internet famous
16:01:48 â€” aeternus: Then it turned into Anti-Atomwaffen crusaders army
16:02:50 â€” mathias: I vaguely remember Vex on IM being at the center of a lot of drama. I never got involved with any of that bullshit because I was a hardcore lurker just soaking up the knowledge from Slavros, Hyperborean, Zeiger.
16:02:58 â€” aeternus: It was actually pretty funny. Tried interviewing Patrick Little then Little scolded Chilliers on how to interview people and hung up
16:03:33 â€” mathias: Have a link?
16:03:41 â€” aeternus: Nah
16:03:48 â€” aeternus: He streamed it on Twitch but i think he deleted it
16:03:51 â€” mathias: np
16:04:55 â€” aeternus: E-Drama got so irritating that I took a 2 week break from ever touching my computer
16:05:42 â€” mathias: I keep myself at a safe distance from the drama
16:06:05 â€” mathias: I see people disavowing Siege and AWD and all sorts of other stupid shit
16:06:16 â€” mathias: But at the end of the day they're still the only ones putting out a solid message
16:06:26 â€” aeternus: Yeah I've learned to never use shit like Discord or be around people known to gossip or cause drama
16:06:29 â€” mathias: Everyone else is fucking around on Gab and Twitter and Facebook
16:06:36 â€” mathias: Discord especially
16:07:05 â€” mathias: There's a sickness in the culture surrounding that shitty platform
16:07:35 â€” mathias: That and the fact that its an insecure chat service means there's no reason for me to use it
16:07:38 â€” mathias: not that this is secure
16:07:56 â€” mathias: but it's suits my taste
16:08:06 â€” aeternus: Lol when I just installed Riot it asked me to let them use user data
16:08:14 â€” aeternus: Still better than Discord though
16:09:11 â€” aeternus: Not a problem though. Just gotta not be fucking idiot and don't write incriminating stuff
16:09:49 â€” mathias: Basically
16:10:43 â€” mathias: Anyone that trusts any open platform without using PGP to communicate is fucked
16:11:33 â€” aeternus: *glances to catholic trad fashy goys who are planning some shit right now*
16:11:46 â€” mathias: I've considered running my own irc
16:11:53 â€” mathias: but I'm frankly not that motivated
16:12:12 â€” mathias: > _glances to catholic trad fashy goys who are planning some shit right now_

on Discord I'm sure
16:18:45 â€” aeternus: Anyway you got any further plans for FF? Network sites (something similar to ropeculture for example), outdoor projects?
16:19:22 â€” mathias: If we get that level of interest, sure.
16:22:01 â€” mathias: I'm primarily concerned with bringing the right people to the forum. From there anything is possible.
16:23:01 â€” mathias: I'm not much of a writer and most of what I know is practical knowledge.
16:23:24 â€” mathias: So something like ropeculture would need someone who 'writes'.
16:24:44 â€” aeternus: Don't know if I'm much of a writer but I could try if you decide to start something like that
16:27:06 â€” mathias: I appreciate the offer. We'll just have to see how things progress over the next few months. I've still got a number of things I need to write / finish writing on the forum.
16:28:07 â€” aeternus: But yeah purity spiraling should be the main focus right now
16:28:14 â€” aeternus: And building the forum
16:28:15 â€” mathias: If you ever have any advice for the forum, as far as direction or anything, definitely share
16:28:32 â€” mathias: I take everything into consideration
16:28:53 â€” aeternus: Got nothing just yet but if it comes up I'll tell you
16:30:40 â€” aeternus: Going now, thanks for the convo. 88
